I’m a strongly-typed, compiled language kinda guy in a lose wishy-washy world controlled by the devil himself… JavaScript and all his cronies who don’t like curly braces 🐍 and prefer to use a fucking indent to convoy scope and intent, waste of a perfectly good key never to be used again because it “looks better”… it doesn’t.

Tech I’m interested in consists of distributed systems so when my unicorn startup needs to scale to a billion concurrent users overnight it can all run on a BBC Micro in the back of a shed.
Crypto is elusive enough to pique my interest and I’ve seen some good uses and implementations of it but they seem to be logs of gold shit lost in an endless overflowing torrent of shit ideas and scams there to be found however virtually useless to mere mortals.

Communication and social is always interesting as a primary function of not just human life but our culture, I honestly can’t believe how many times a chat application can be “reworked” and “innovated” upon to make a fuck load of money! and be acquired by another enormous tech “company” that is definitely not monopolistic at all duh they all have “stories” (that's a case of tech companies not even bothering to gobble up the competition but everyone just copying Snapchat 😢 ). Well, at least now (20/05/21) Signal and Telegram seem to be doing slightly more than fuck all for anti-trust compared to the FTC.

This is me...
